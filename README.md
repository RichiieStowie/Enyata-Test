## Generate Coverage Report

From the main menu, select Run | Generate Coverage Report, or click the Generate Coverage Report button in the Coverage tool window.

Note that this option becomes available only after you run the necessary tests with coverage.

In the Generate Coverage Report dialog, specify the directory in which the generated report should be stored, and optionally select the Open generated HTML in browser checkbox.

If there are several projects opened in the same window, make sure that the suggested output directory is correct.

Click Save.

## Run tests
Place the caret at the test class to run all tests in that class, or at the test method, and press ⌃ ⇧ R. Alternatively, click the gutter icon next to the test class or test method.

The gutter icon changes depending on the state of your test:

The the Run button gutter icon marks new tests.

The the Run test icon gutter icon marks successful tests.

The the Rerun the Run button gutter icon marks failed tests.
